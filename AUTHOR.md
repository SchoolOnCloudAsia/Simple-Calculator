## About the Author

I am an enthusiastic software developer interested in creating practical and user-friendly applications.  My journey in programming began several years ago, and I have since enjoyed exploring various programming languages and technologies.

My primary goal in creating this Simple Calculator project is to supply a straightforward tool for users to perform basic arithmetic calculations quickly.  Simplicity and ease of use are essential aspects of any software, and I have designed this calculator with those principles in mind.

Apart from coding, I am enthusiastic about open-source development and believe in the power of collaboration and community-driven projects.  I encourage contributions and feedback from fellow developers and users to improve this calculator.

Thank you for checking out this project, and I hope you find it helpful in your everyday tasks.

If you have any questions or suggestions or would like to collaborate, please feel free to contact me through my [GitHub profile] (https://github.com/benjaminyjr12) or via email at BENJ0045@E.NTU.EDU.SG.

Happy calculating!
