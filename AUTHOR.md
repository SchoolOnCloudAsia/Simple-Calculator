## About the Author

I am a passionate software developer with a strong interest in creating practical and user-friendly applications. My journey in programming began several years ago, and I have since enjoyed exploring various programming languages and technologies.

My primary goal in creating this Simple Calculator project is to provide a straightforward tool for users to perform basic arithmetic calculations quickly. I believe that simplicity and ease of use are essential aspects of any software, and I have designed this calculator with those principles in mind.

Apart from coding, I am enthusiastic about open-source development and believe in the power of collaboration and community-driven projects. I encourage contributions and feedback from fellow developers and users to make this calculator even better.

Thank you for checking out this project, and I hope you find it helpful in your everyday tasks.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to collaborate, please feel free to get in touch with me through my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/benjaminyjr12) or via email at BENJ0045@E.NTU.EDU.SG.

Happy calculating!
